1. Download the target image to a hand held smart device (phone, tablet), or print the graphic onto a piece of paper in standard business card dimensions. You can download the target image [HERE](./Assets/card.JPG).
2. Scan the QR code on the target image graphic to launch the application via a secondary device with a camera (phone, tablet), or launch the application on a computer via the link [HERE](https://chrisvanndy.github.io/MindAR_BusinessCard/)

4. Using a mouse or finger touches, explore the 3D UI (Play Video, click to external links) the camera must keep the target image in frame to display the 3D UI.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT
This WebXR business card was built as a light weight alternative to linking peers and industry professionals to a static portfolio.  The Project utilizes image detection to launch a 3D user interface which in and of itself showcases XR development skills.  The UI anchors to a target image (business card) and allows users to experience my work in a world space, watch a short video of the work I've completed this year, and navigate to my external social media profiles. 

## THE GOAL
Many people will have their first experience with XR technologies today.  It is my goal to continue innovating and creating works that anyone with a smart device can easily access and engage with without needing access to a headset or application download. I believe this is the future of XR, marketing, and digital experience.
